Project Overview
App Name: app-1a

Purpose: Building a comprehensive enterprise application with a focus on decision-making engines and task management.

Progress Summary
Engines Developed:

engine_one.js: Basic decision-making engine.
engine_two.js: Orchestration engine integrating rules, notifications, and database operations.
engine_three.js: Temporal decision-making engine.
engine_four.js: Advanced decision-making engine with enhanced flexibility.
engine_five.js: Task management engine.
Infrastructure:

Set up a robust server infrastructure using Express.js.
Integrated MongoDB for database operations.
Established routes for each engine to handle specific requests.
Implemented utilities for error handling, logging, and database operations.
UI/UX:

Initiated the integration of Vue.js for a dynamic and interactive user interface.
Planning to build an interactive UI to facilitate decision-making processes.
Code Quality & Collaboration:

Multiple rounds of code reviews and optimizations by a team of 21 engineers.
Received feedback and recommendations from NASA engineers with IBM backgrounds.
Continuous collaboration and "murder boarding" sessions to ensure code quality and efficiency.
Directory Structure
config: Contains configuration files.
controllers: Houses the logic for handling requests and responses.
middleware: Middleware functions for request processing.
models: Data models for MongoDB.
public: Static files and frontend assets.
routes: Express routes for handling API endpoints.
services: Business logic and service layer.
utilities: Helper functions and utilities like logging and error handling.
views: (Planned) Vue.js components and views.
Next Steps
Continue the development of the interactive UI using Vue.js.
Further optimize and refine the existing engines based on feedback.
Expand the application's capabilities by integrating more modules and features.
Ensure comprehensive logging and monitoring for production readiness.
